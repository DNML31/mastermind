If you’ve never played Mastermind, a game where you have to guess your opponent’s secret code within a certain number of turns (like hangman with colored pegs), 
check it out on Wikipedia. Each turn you get some feedback about how good your 
guess was – whether it was exactly correct or just the correct color but in the wrong space.

Build a Mastermind game from the command line where you have 12 turns to guess 
the secret code, starting with you guessing the computer’s random code.
